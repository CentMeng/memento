# Memento
Memento is an annotation processor for Android that gives your activities a memory. 
It introduces the `@Retain` annotation, which allows you to retain arbitrary fields
of an activity across configuration changes in a simple and type-safe manner.

# Overview
On Android, `Activity` instances will get destroyed by the runtime whenever configuration changes occur such as a change in screen orientation. Since this will cause the activity to go through an `onDestroy`/`onCreate` cycle, all instance state is lost.

This is especially troublesome when one needs to retain concurrent objects, such as running `AsyncTasks`. Without retaining their state when the activity gets destroyed, results will be lost unless cached and redelivered to the activity.
In earlier days, one was to use the `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance` callback, which is not type-safe, is cumbersome to use, and is today deprecated in favour of using fragments that `setRetainInstance(true)`.

While introducing fragments helps retaining state on a per-fragment basis, shared data that is to be delivered to any number of embedded fragments must be duplicated in each of them, or manually shifted to a shared background fragment.

Memento solves all these issues in an elegant, simple, and type-safe way by generating companion fragments for your activities that retain shared state.

# Setup
Memento is published as a Maven artifact. If you're using Android Studio, add the following config to your `build.gradle`:

    configurations {
      apt // create a new classpath for Java APT processors
    }
    
    dependencies {
      // pulls in dependency for the client library
      compile 'com.github.mttkay.memento:memento:0.1'
      
      // pulls in dependency for APT
      apt 'com.github.mttkay.memento:memento-processor:0.1'
    }
    
    afterEvaluate { project ->
        android.applicationVariants.each { variant ->
            variant.javaCompile.options.compilerArgs += [
                    '-classpath', configurations.compile.asPath,
                    '-processorpath', configurations.apt.asPath,
                    '-processor', 'com.github.mttkay.memento.MementoProcessor'
            ]
        }
    }

# Usage
Using the library involves just three steps:

### 1. Annotate fields
In your activity, use the `@Retain` annotation to annotate fields that are to survive configuration
changes. **Annotated fields cannot be private.**

    // in your Activity class
    @Retain AsyncTask mTask;
    ...
    
### 2. Implement launch hook
Memento adds a new life-cycle hook to your activies: `onLaunch`. This event signals that your activity
was created for the first time, contrary to e.g. being recreated due to a configuration change.
In `onLaunch`, initialize any member fields that are supposed to be created just once, when the activity
first starts. **The activity must inherit from FragmentActivity; support for Honeycomb+ activities
with built in fragment support will be added shortly.**

    public class MyActivity extends FragmentActivity implements MementoCallbacks {
    
        @Override
        public void onLaunch() {
           mTask = new AsyncTask() { ... };
        }
    }
    
### 3. Bind Activity
Execute Memento to either initialize or restore annotated fields in `onCreate`:

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Memento.retain(this);
        ...
    }
    
On the first call to `onCreate`, this will invoke the `onLaunch` hook. Otherwise, it will restore
any fields previously initialized in that hook.
